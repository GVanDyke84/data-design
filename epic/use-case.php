			<p>Johnny McDucketts just got back from class and will be starting a highly anticipated online poker tournament shortly. He is wearing a new hat from one of his sponsors and has strategically held off on favoriting the hat and sharing it with his followers until this very moment as he knows his audience will be very active right before the tournament starts. His PC is already set up for the tournament, and he needs to login to the e-commerce site on his mobile device and favorite the hat he recently received and is currently wearing, and share this favorite with his social media audience. Timing is critical and getting it just right could mean a large difference in his affiliate marketing commission. Johnny enters his profile ID into his Samsung Galaxy 7 and logs in successfully. He presses the favorite button and he then receives a prompt in which he clicks to share to his facebook and instagram accounts.</p>
