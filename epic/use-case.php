			<p>Johnny McDucketts just got back from class and will be starting a highly anticipated online poker tournament shortly. He is wearing a new hat from one of his sponsors and has strategically held off on favoriting the hat and sharing it with his followers until this moment, because he knows his audience will be very active right before the tournament starts. His PC is already set up for the tournament, and he needs to login to the site on his mobile device and favorite the hat he recently received and is currently wearing, and be able to share this favorite with his audience. Timing is critical and getting it just right could mean a large difference in his affiliate marketing commission.</p>
